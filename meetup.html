    <p>Meetup.com is a popular platform for finding and attending events near you.
      People use it to deepen their professional skills, explore personal interests,
      and generally to socialize with people nearby that have similar interests.</p>

        <p>Meetup’s tagline is <em>“Find your people”</em>, which I have done, however, after
          attending a few of these events, I realized that there isn’t a great way to
          stay connected to the people I meet at events. There <em>is</em> a minimal messaging system,
          but in order to connect with someone on a social network,
          I would have to remember their name or remember to get a
          business card. </p>
        <p>If I fail at either, (which is likely to happen after meeting 20+ people)
        I could check the RSVP list on the event page on Meetup (easy, usually 25–30 people),
           but if that person didn’t RSVP, I would have to browse the member list (difficult,
           sometimes 1000+ members).</p>
       <p>Once I succeeded at getting a name, I would then have to find them on
         Facebook and go through the process of adding them to the right list to
         hide personal information, or finding them on LinkedIn, where the UI is
         frightful and you are prompted at every other screen to connect with
         someone from your email contact list.</p>

       <div class="col-md-6"><p>I sought to address this this multi-platform hullabaloo
         by bringing everything back into one platform.
         By allowing people to “friend” each other on Meetup,
         users would be encouraged to stay within the framework for events,
         networking, and communication. It would subsequently allow people to
         view their friends’ Meetup groups and interests, which would encourage
         exploration of interests one might not necessarily explore on his/her own.</p>

       <div class="col-md-6"><p>To validate this theory, we need some evidence.
          I started by recruiting volunteers across a variety of social networking
          platforms including Meetup, Facebook, Reddit, and LinkedIn. With 28
          survey respondents and 5 interviewees, the data was eye-opening. Of
          those who took the survey, everyone had used some form of social
          network for longer than 3 years. Over 89% of respondents reported both
          using social media multiple times per day and using social networking
          to find an event at least once a month. That’s a lot of socializing!</p></div>

    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-3"></div>
      <div class="col-md-6"><p>For my interviews, I chose mainly people who
        responded that they used or had heard of Meetup, and were in the
        demographic of social network users. All 4 of the 18–34 interviewees
        reported finding it difficult to meet new friends and socialize after
        college. Interestingly, the one older user (55–64) I interviewed said
        that she didn’t have a need nor want for more friends.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-3"></div>
      <div class="col-md-6"><blockquote><em>“I’m a little cautious about adding
        people to my Facebook… It’s very difficult to go back in and delete all
        these stupid things that have been posted over the years… So I decided
        to start fresh with a new Facebook account.”</em></blockquote></div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-3"></div>
      <div class="col-md-6"><p>Something that came up among all the younger
        (read: millenial) population was a nervousness or fear of new friends
        and professionals seeing incriminating photos that they might have been
        tagged in during their younger years. Some opted to create entirely new
        accounts or risk using Facebook by changing their security settings.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-3"></div>
      <div class="col-md-6"><blockquote><em>“I don’t even accept LinkedIn

        qualifications.”</em></blockquote></div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-3"></div>
      <div class="col-md-6"><p>Another issue with connecting with people arose
        from LinkedIn. Two of the millenial interviewees reported feeling
        intimidated to start casual conversations on a “professional” platform,
        while the older respondent reported that she wouldn’t even connect with
        a person if she couldn’t vouch for his/her skill because she viewed the
        platform as a digital resumé.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-3"></div>
      <div class="col-md-6"><p>When I explored the issues further, I found that
        all the interviewees used social networks as vetting tools when meeting
        someone new and needed some background information. Existing platforms
        were either too personal or too professional. This is where Meetup can
        fill a niche opening in social networking with a casual, public-facing
        profile system that people will feel comfortable connecting with strangers on.</p>

        <p>Ease of use is a huge factor in keeping users happy, and as such,

        <p>Meetup has some minor issues with its usability that break the
          pattern of general web use. For example, below, the widely accepted
          “logo in the top left is home” pattern is ignored, and has been
          placed in the middle of the navigation bar.</p>

          very easy with large buttons and accessible, understandable language.</p>

        <p>In order to gauge Meetup’s competitiveness with other platforms, I

          <b>Eventbrite</b>, as well as a lesser-known platform, <b>CitySocializer</b>.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, for as popular Facebook is among users, it has some
          poor heuristics in its events finding function. Most noticeably,
          navigating to different subcategories reveals inconsistent sort
          methods where the parameters for sorting were not immediately transparent.</p>
        <p>Eventbrite, on the other hand, was very strong in error prevention
          and recovering from errors, and had strong flexibility for users by
          offering the ability to sort events in many different ways.</p>
