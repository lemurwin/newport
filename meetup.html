    <p>Meetup.com is a popular platform for finding and attending events near you.
      People use it to deepen their professional skills, explore personal interests,
      and generally to socialize with people nearby that have similar interests.</p>

        <p>Meetup’s tagline is <em>“Find your people”</em>, which I have done, however, after
          attending a few of these events, I realized that there isn’t a great way to
          stay connected to the people I meet at events. There <em>is</em> a minimal messaging system,
          but in order to connect with someone on a social network,
          I would have to remember their name or remember to get a
          business card. </p>
        <p>If I fail at either, (which is likely to happen after meeting 20+ people)
        I could check the RSVP list on the event page on Meetup (easy, usually 25–30 people),
           but if that person didn’t RSVP, I would have to browse the member list (difficult,
           sometimes 1000+ members).</p>
       <p>Once I succeeded at getting a name, I would then have to find them on
         Facebook and go through the process of adding them to the right list to
         hide personal information, or finding them on LinkedIn, where the UI is
         frightful and you are prompted at every other screen to connect with
         someone from your email contact list.</p>

         <p>I sought to address this this multi-platform hullabaloo
         by bringing everything back into one platform.
         By allowing people to “friend” each other on Meetup,
         users would be encouraged to stay within the framework for events,
         networking, and communication. It would subsequently allow people to
         view their friends’ Meetup groups and interests, which would encourage
         exploration of interests one might not necessarily explore on his/her own.</p>

         <p>To validate this theory, we need some evidence.
            I started by recruiting volunteers across a variety of social networking
            platforms including Meetup, Facebook, Reddit, and LinkedIn. With 28
            survey respondents and 5 interviewees, the data was eye-opening. Of
            those who took the survey, everyone had used some form of social
            network for longer than 3 years. Over 89% of respondents reported both
            using social media multiple times per day and using social networking
            to find an event at least once a month. That’s a lot of socializing!</p>

      <h3>Interviews for Qualitative Data</h3>
        <p>For my interviews, I chose mainly people who
          responded that they used or had heard of Meetup, and were in the
          demographic of social network users. All 4 of the 18–34 interviewees
          reported finding it difficult to meet new friends and socialize after
          college. Interestingly, the one older user (55–64) I interviewed said
          that she didn’t have a need nor want for more friends.</p>
        <blockquote>“I’m a little cautious about adding
          people to my Facebook… It’s very difficult to go back in and delete all
          these stupid things that have been posted over the years… So I decided
          to start fresh with a new Facebook account.”</blockquote>
        <p>Something that came up among all the younger
          (read: millenial) population was a nervousness or fear of new friends
          and professionals seeing incriminating photos that they might have been
          tagged in during their younger years. Some opted to create entirely new
          accounts or risk using Facebook by changing their security settings.</p>
        <blockquote>“I don’t even accept LinkedIn
          requests unless I can personally vouch for their professional
          qualifications.”</blockquote>
          <p>Another issue with connecting with people arose
            from LinkedIn. Two of the millenial interviewees reported feeling
            intimidated to start casual conversations on a “professional” platform,
            while the older respondent reported that she wouldn’t even connect with
            a person if she couldn’t vouch for his/her skill because she viewed the
            platform as a digital resumé.</p>
      <h3>Interview Takeaways</h3>
        <p>When I explored the issues further, I found that
        all the interviewees used social networks as vetting tools when meeting
        someone new and needed some background information. Existing platforms
        were either too personal or too professional. This is where Meetup can
        fill a niche opening in social networking with a casual, public-facing
        profile system that people will feel comfortable connecting with strangers on.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-3"></div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>Ease of use is a huge factor in keeping users happy, and as such,
          comparing the existing platform with its competitors was important in
          the development of new features because users will already be
          familiar with their use.</p>
        <h3>Meetup.com</h3>
        <p>Meetup has some minor issues with its usability that break the
          pattern of general web use. For example, below, the widely accepted
          “logo in the top left is home” pattern is ignored, and has been
          placed in the middle of the navigation bar.</p>
        <p>However, Meetup does have a strong match between other existing
          patterns, such as calendar view, page consistency across the site,
          and well-labeled actions and buttons. Finding and attending events is
          very easy with large buttons and accessible, understandable language.</p>

          <h3>Other Platforms</h3>
          <p>In order to gauge Meetup’s competitiveness with other platforms, I
            analyzed a few other well-known players, including <b>Facebook</b> and
            <b>Eventbrite</b>, as well as a lesser-known platform, <b>CitySocializer</b>.</p>
          <p>Surprisingly, for as popular Facebook is among users, it has some
            poor heuristics in its events finding function. Most noticeably,
            navigating to different subcategories reveals inconsistent sort
            methods where the parameters for sorting were not immediately transparent.</p>
          <p>Eventbrite, on the other hand, was very strong in error prevention
            and recovering from errors, and had strong flexibility for users by
            offering the ability to sort events in many different ways.</p>

        motivations to guide what features an MVP would need, and how each persona
        would use them. All three personas would need to connect with other users
        at some point, so friending a person seemed to be the most relevant feature.</p>

        <p>Following the <b>“As a User, I want…”</b> pattern, I came up with a variety
          of stories that each persona would follow, and then compared them
          against each other to come up with a list of features that would apply
          to all three personas. On this list was messaging ability, ability to
          view other user interests, a list of members attending, and a social
          wall or board for other users to post media.</p>

      <h3>Card Sorting for Clarity</h3>
      <p>After deciding on the features for the MVP, I had to organize where
        each feature should reside on the platform. To create cards, I selected
        user stories and converted them into simple actions. Then, I used
        existing locations on the website as the categories in which to sort.
        I recruited 4 people, within the age demographic, and both who had used
        and not used Meetup, to participate in a card sort. After the sort, I
        was able to decide where each feature would be found.</p>

          immediately place the cards that everyone had agreed on, but for the
          cards where there had been disagreement, I based their locations on
          existing patterns that other social networking sites used.</p>

        <p>Visualising the user flows like this helped a great deal when
          catching errors and omissions in functionality and pages. For example,
          I was able to catch where I had forgotten to list upcoming events
          on the site map, which saved me time when I started drawing wireframes.</p>

          <h3>Initial Wireframes</h3>
          <p>Because Meetup already has a basic profile, I started designing
            from the existing layout to facilitate a smooth transition and site
            homogeneity.</p>

          <p>While the site map and user flows helped with the organization of
            what information should be on <em>which</em> page, the wireframing helped to
            organize the information <em>on</em> the page layout. Initially, I thought
            to show all the relevant information at once, but this approach
            resulted in a look that was too crowded and busy to easily discern
            what each subsection was.</p>

          <p>Taking a page from Facebook, I opted for a tabbed approach to
            separate the distinct subsections of Group Memberships, Friends,
            Interests, and a Bulletin Board. This resulted in a cleaner,
            easily navigable layout that doesn’t distract the user’s eye.</p>

          <h3>Building a Prototype</h3>
          <p>Because this project was based on an existing platform, I was able
            to streamline much of the process by using screenshots of the
            existing platform and photoshopping in some of the features. Once
            they were edited, I imported them into Sketch
            to have a better overview of flow and composition of each page.</p>
          <p>With the layouts completed and my wireframes converted to higher
            fidelity, I exported the boards to InVision to layout navigation
            using the web platform.</p>

          guideline and troubleshooting for this, I started by creating screens
          that were based on my user flows and adding more as necessary.</p></div>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p>Because my goal was to improve the social
      functioning of the platform, I tested users to see if the redesign
      was usable. As a result, I asked participants to 1) Find their profile,
      2) Post media to a friend, 3) Find out what groups a friend was part of,
      4) View the interests of a friend or stranger, and 5) View meetups based
      on a specific interest.</p>

      <h3>Initial Troubleshooting</h3>
      <blockquote>“This is confusing. Why is there so much going on? This isn’t good.”</blockquote>

      <p>Unfortunately, testing the prototype did not go as smoothly as I had
        planned. I was unable to schedule participants who fit into the main
        demographics I had researched and who were current Meetup users. As a
        result, two of the subjects were immediately baffled by the landing page
        that would appear after a login and set a poor first impression in the test.</p>

      <h2>Learning from Errors</h2>

      <p>However, this confusion provided a great learning insight into first
        time users. All the participants, feeling confused by the landing page,
        headed to the search function first. By using the added universal
        search in the navigation bar, participants were able to easily
        accomplish all the tasks.</p>

        <blockquote>“Oh, this part is kind of like Facebook. That’s easy.”</blockquote>

        <p>Once the participants found the updated profile, which borrows
          patterns from existing social networks, the rest of the testing went
          relatively smoothly. The tabbed organization resulted in quick
          information retrieval as expected.</p>

        <p>I had a bit of a learning curve when facilitating the testing,
          as I hadn’t thought that the order of tasks mattered as much until I
          noticed my first participant struggling with task 5, which I had
          initially placed as task 1. After my first test participant, I
          learned that the order of tasks should build from simple to complex,
          providing a scaffold for information. I hadn’t noticed this problem
          initially because I had worked so closely with the platform that I
          didn’t realize which actions users would find to be complex. After
          revising the order, the other two participants struggled far less.</p>
